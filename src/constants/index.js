export const ABOUT_TEXT_P1 = `I first learned how to code in the 12th grade in an AP Comp Sci class I decided to sign up for last minute because my friend was doing it too. I always thought coding was super complicated and I didn't understand
why other students would pick it as their elective. I'd always pick electives like art and dance. However, this class quickly became my favourite class in the 12th grade. Coding become a creative outlet that I once thought could only
be found in things like art and dance.

export const ABOUT_TEXT_P2 = `Fast forward to the present day where I graduated with a degree in computer engineering. I am constantly learning new skills with the things I build. While most of my experience lies in 
backend web development, I love learning and taking on new challenges like teaching myself React (hence this website!) as I work towards becoming a well-rounded full stack developer.
